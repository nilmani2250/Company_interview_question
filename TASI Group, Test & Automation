Which specific Board Support Packages (BSPs) have you worked on and contributed to?
Which peripherals have you written driver-level or low-level code for, and what was your involvement in board bring-up?
Can you explain the difference between I2C and SPI communication protocols?
Why is I2C communication slower compared to SPI?
What is SPI?
If a hardware designer has only three SPI lines available instead of four, and wants to interface with one slave, is it possible? If so, which line would you compromise?
Can you explain the difference between TCP/IP and UDP protocols, especially in the context of Ethernet communication?
Given an embedded device communicating over Ethernet with a web server, which protocol (TCP or UDP) would you use for live sensor data updates and which for configuration, and why?
In your router or device project, was the MAC (Media Access Controller) inbuilt in the microcontroller or external, and what was the interface between the microcontroller and the MAC?
When working on Ethernet, were the MAC and PHY internal or external, and what was the interface between them?
What was the interface between the internal and external components you mentioned (specifically, the MAC)?
Can you explain the function of interrupts?
Have you worked on static variables? Can you explain what static variables are?
Can a static variable declared in one file be accessed from another file? Can I use extern static in another file?
 If I want to use a static variable in another file, can I do that?
If I want to access the data of a static variable from another file, is there any way to do that?
